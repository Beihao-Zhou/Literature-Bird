# Literature Bird

## What it does
One of the main features of this web application is searching meanings of words in various languages, including English, Hindi, French and so on. The big title at the top of the app reflects your typing in real-time. The searching outcome would include the word’s audio, definitions, examples and synonyms. Under the searching window, there is a place for you to take note of your quotes, keywords (Probably accompanied by the definitions, examples and synonyms searched before), thoughts and insights while reading. This can be done by filling the text area under the previous notes and pressing enter. You can also keep a record of your reading progress and learning outcomes here. If you want to delete something from the list, just click on it. (When you hover on it, there is a line crossing the words.) 
I have also implemented a feature that allows the app to switch between light mode and dark mode. Considering reading for a long time might be tiring, I hope this feature can help you relax to some extent. 
 
## How I built it
I used React library as the app’s web framework, which makes it convenient for me to create interactive UIs and encapsulated components that manage their state. Besides, Material-UI is also imported for creating more customizable React components, including the text areas, select box and search result container. I also implemented a word search engine for many languages using dictionary API to fetch words’ definitions, examples, synonyms and audios. Lastly, this app is an installable and responsively designed Progressive Web App (PWAs), which uses service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features in combination with progressive enhancement, to give users an experience with native apps. 


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
